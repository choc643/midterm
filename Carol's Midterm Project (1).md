I have investigated five stocks from the S&P 500, government bond, and metal. The corporate stocks include Adobe Systems, Bed Bath & Beyond, Costco, Harley Davidson, and Home Depot. For the government bond, I chose the Daily Treasury Long-Term Real Average (10 years) and for the metal, I went for Platinum.

Below in Chart 1, first of all, you can find out the adjusted closing price of the stocks in 2000 and 2016. According to nest.com, adjusted closing price is more precise when valuing a stock because it incorporates dividends, stock splits, and new stock offerings into its account. So based on these prices, I analyzed each of the stock's annual interest rates.

You will then be able to track the annual balance of each stock beginning with initial investment of $500 from 2000 to 2016.

Figure 1 displays which investments have made the best growth after 16 years. Taxes and Inflation are not taken into consideration at this point. Adobe Systems has benefited greatly from the changes in the company's value over time. The investors including myself have gained the most profit from this share as well.

As you can find out from Figure 2, Adobe has the highest annual interest rates, 13.4%, which enables a higher earning than rest of the stocks. Since interests from stocks are compounded annually, the higher the interest rates are, the more amount you have in your account.

Below in Chart 2, you can see the rate of return calculated for each share. Without any tax or inflation applied, Adobe reached 647.84% of percentage increase in their stock price. That is almost 42 times more than the listed government bond. Among the five stocks, Harley Davidson was the least successful investment during this period. It is also quite interesting that summing the rates of the three large retailers, which are Bed Bath & Beyond, Costco, and Home Depot, still cannot defeat that of the software company, Adobe.

Now let's take a closer look at the actual values of investment after applying taxes and inflation.

## Chart 2

The 2016 capital gains tax rate is 10%. Since the total income does not exceed $9,275, it does not matter whether I am filing tax individually or not. Within this range, the tax bracket is also fixed to 10%. There is one thing that comes to mind, which is the fact that Long-term capital gains rate is 0%. The long term used in this category is defined as holding one's assets for longer than a year. Since we are looking into constant investments for 16 years, we should rather stick with the 10% tax bracket to proceed this project.

Regarding this fact, the taxed amount for each investment is written above. For taxing stocks, we take them out only for the final amount, which belongs to the balance at the end of the year. So for the five stocks, we apply 10% tax out of the 2016 final values. Bonds, on the other hand, has a different taxation, since T-bills are paid out each year. I used the formula of After-Tax Value of an Investment to estimate the tax amount. For platinum, I taxed the amount I earned, which is 10% of (908.09-500). The capital gain of Adobe stock was taxed the most.

After taking out taxes, inflation should be considered. The US inflation calculator points out the cumulative rate of inflation as 39.4%; therefore, the earlier investment of 500 dollars in 2000 becomes 696.88 dollars in 2016. Putting this in mind, we can finalize the profits from the investment. For the five stocks, just simply taking out 696.88 dollars instead of 500 dollars from the final values, which are the taxed final amounts, brings me the pure profits. For bonds, I used the formula of Value of an Investment Adjusted for Taxes and Inflation. To calculate this number, I need the annual inflation rate. This can be just solved by using the general compound interest formula. The annual rate, therefore, turns out to be 2.1%, and when applied to the Daily Treasury LT Real Average (10 years), I discover this investment gave negative real returns of -131.23.

At last, I can view the true value of my investments taking in all the factors such as tax and inflation to the account. The final rate of return results in these percentages. The best investment still was the Adobe stock, and the worst was the Daily Treasury. I found out that government bonds or T-bills are not safe for dispersing my assets. Stocks are risky as well in real life. If you believe in high-risk high return, invest in Adobe stocks but not on Harley. Figure 3 also illustrates the most investment made by the 100% pie chart.

------------------


Now let's do a new investment project based on the final value and the profit gained.

As you can see it in Chart 3, I dispersed $10,000 to each of the shares to see how much I'll benefit from the final values after 16 years.

## Chart 3

The above chart also includes what I'll be receiving at the end of 2016, the credited amounts after being taxed, and the final value of all after considering the inflation.

For better understanding, there are graphs below to determine whether the investment was successfull than the previous project.

## Figure 4
<img src="Pic_1.png"width=650>

Figure 4 shows the distribution rate in each investments by the pie chart. Since Adobe Systems stock had the best growth and return rate, 40% of the initial investment was alloted to this business. Then it goes to Bed Bath & Beyond and other business based on the return rate. Only 1% of $10,000 was invested to  Daily Treasury LT Real Average (10 years) to reduce any risks or losses.

## Figure 5
<img src="Pic_2.png"width=650>

In 2016, the most valuable final profit, which takes out the tax and inflation from the final amount after 16 years, was made by Adobe Systems. The amount invested was 40% in the beginning, but at the end, the Adobe stock dominated the pie chart by 78%. Investing to Adobe turned out to be a great decision overall.

From investing in Adobe, I have earned 21,347.17 dollars which is five times more than the starting amount. The return rate was same as when I put 500 dollars to this stock. The other investments all shared same or similar return rate like the previous investment of $500. 

So by looking at the return rate during a particular period and calculating how much I will gain are essential previous to any investments. 

## Figure 6
<img src="Pic_3.png"width=650>

The last graph, Figure 6, clearly shows the changes in value by time and after tax/inflation deduction.

Consequently, the estimated final values except the Adobe stock are apparent that the 16 years of investment to these shares were not worth it. The four stocks, government bond, and platinum investment turned out to be kind of break-even.
